            <h2>Responsive Progress - 20 Jan. 2024</h2>
            <p>Hey there how's it going, I'm very happy with this updated design of my portfolio. To make it better I wanna add JavaScript elements
                and animatons to make the page feel livlier, such as a custom cursor, and maybe make the index page social media links easier to see by putting them in a colored box. Overall, I'm getting fairly comfortable with the design aspect of websitess now, and
                looking towards the rest of the course, I'm hoping to learn the back-end and how to apply JS.

            <h2>1st journal entry - 13 Jan. 2024</h2>
            <p>Hello, I attended the DeltaHacks XI hackathon this weekend, hosted at McMaster, and exposed to a lot of
                web dev beyond this course
                (<span class="technologies">React, ExpressJS, Flask,</span> etc.), and other languages and technologies.
                Our team's project was a printable guitar that used computer vision and inputted our own training
                dataset
                to help anyone, anywhere, learn the guitar without spending $200-300 on a real guitar. In just 24 hours
                (actually 12 after sleeping for 7 hours) I gained experience
                trying to host our site on Netlify, and although our "backend" machine learning and "frontend" website
                worked, due to an error I wasn't able to deploy. Now onto the present, I love that 1XD3 is now taught in
                JavaScript
                instead of <span class="technologies">Elm</span> and I also like Dr. Scott and his textbook. I have
                prior experience with <span class="technologies"> JavaScript</span>, having taught children game
                development in it as my part-time job.
